Kalman Filtering

- recursive estimator. Does not require history of observations to compute current state estimate
- state of the filter is represented by two variables: the a posteriori state estimate at a time k (xk) and the a posteriori estimate covariance matrix Pk (measure of accuracy of the state estimate)
- It's called the a posteriori state estimate coz it doesn't factor in the current state information. 

Algorithm structure
- resembles alpha beta filter
    Initialize
    - set initial values of state estimates x,v using prior info, else 0
    - select values of alpha and beta correction gains
    Update
    - Repeat for every time step
    Iterate
    - Send updated x and v (optional) as the filter outputs

- two phases : predict and update
